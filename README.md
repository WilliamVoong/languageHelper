# languageHelper
As my mother and girlfriend is learning swedish, i noticed that it was inefficient for them to find words in their dictionary, 
and even more inefficient to find the related grammar forms for a word. Therefore i created a application which handled this task.

The application works like this. Once the user typed something into the textbox, and presses enter, the language will be detected and automatically 
be translated into swedish. Shortly the phrase will be queried find a related webpage, downloading the html, and extract relevant  data from the html to find the related wordforms for the word. The reason why i resorted to webscraping  was because i didn't find a suitable API. If a sentence is typed, the user can click the words in the display box to make a query for the wordform. The user always has the option to copy the translated word into the clip board.
