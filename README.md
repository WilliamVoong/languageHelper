# languageHelper
As my mother and girlfriend is learning swedish, i noticed that it was inefficient for her to find words in her dictionary, 
and even more inefficient to find the related grammar forms for a word. Therefore i created a application which handled this task.

The application works like this. Once the user typed something into the textbox, and presses enter, the language will be detected and automatically 
be translated into swedish. Shortly the phrase will be queried using webscraping to gather data for its related wordsforms, the reason why i did this 
was because i didn't find a suitable API, therefore i needed to resort to webscraping. If a sentence is typed, the user can click the words in the display box 
to make a query for the wordform.
